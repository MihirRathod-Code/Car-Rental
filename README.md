# Car-Rental
A car rental website based on Asp.net and C#, Used template of "expedia.com" for frontend. 

The car rental website project is a sophisticated solution that allows customers to book rental cars online, while also providing a platform for drivers to manage their bookings. The project is divided into three main sites: the admin, driver, and user sites, with each site serving a distinct purpose.

The customer site is designed to facilitate online car rental bookings. It provides an intuitive user interface that enables users to browse available rental cars, select their preferred vehicle, and make a reservation.

One of the key features of the website is the advanced search functionality that allows users to filter rental cars based on a range of criteria, such as vehicle type, location, and rental period. The search functionality is supported by an advanced backend that manages data and ensures that customer information is stored securely.

The driver site is designed to enable drivers to manage their bookings efficiently. Drivers can use the site to accept or decline bookings, view their schedules, and manage their availability.

The admin site is designed to provide administrators with a comprehensive platform to manage the website's data and functionality. Administrators can use the site to manage customer bookings, driver availability, and rental car inventory. 

The website's advanced filtering and validation functionality ensure that all customer bookings are processed accurately and efficiently. The website is designed to handle high volumes of traffic, ensuring that customers can make bookings and drivers can manage their schedules without any issues.

To sum up, the car rental website project is a sophisticated and well-designed solution that provides a comprehensive platform for car rental bookings. Its use of Asp.Net, C#, HTML5, CSS, SQL Server, JavaScript, Visual Studio, and MS server management studio ensures that it is highly responsive and scalable, making it an ideal solution for both small and large car rental businesses.
